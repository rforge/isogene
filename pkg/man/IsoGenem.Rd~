\title{The five test statistics calculated for both the increasing and
  decreasing trends}
\description{
  The function calculates the values for the five test statistics (the
  global likelihood test, Williams, Marcus, M, and the modified M) for
  testing increasing and decreasing alternatives.
}
\usage{
IsoGene1(x, y)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{indicates the dose levels}
  \item{y}{is the gene expression for one gene}
}
\value{
   A list with components 
  \item{E2.up}{the test statistic of global likelihood test for testing
    increasing alternative.}
  \item{Williams.up}{the test statistic of Williams for testing
    increasing alternative.}
  \item{Marcus.up }{the test statistic of Marcus for testing increasing
    alternative.}
  \item{M.up }{the M test statistic for testing increasing alternative.}
\item{ModM.up }{the test statistic of the modified M for testing
  increasing alternative.}
  \item{E2.dn }{the test statistic of Williams for testing increasing alternative.}
\item{Williams.dn }{the test statistic of global likelihood test for
  testing increasing alternative.}
  \item{Marcus.dn }{the test statistic of Williams for testing
    increasing alternative.}
\item{M.dn}{the test statistic of global likelihood test for testing
  increasing alternative.}
  \item{ModM.dn}{the test statistic of Williams for testing increasing alternative.}
\item{direction}{the direction with the higher likelihood of increasing
  (indicated by "u") or decreasing (indicated by "d") trend.}
